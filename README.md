# The wine evaluation analysis

### Date created
February 7, 2020

### Description

Wine is important for civilized humans, or at least to my thought.

Then, what makes some wine more popular than other wine?

The primary purpose of this project is to answer 3 questions :

1.  Q: Do wines with higher alcoholic content receive better ratings? 

2.  Q: Do sweeter wines receive higher ratings?

3.  Q: What level of acidity receives the highest average rating?

Thank you so much for reading this.
