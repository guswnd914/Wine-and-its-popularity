# The wine evaluation analysis

### Date created
February 7, 2020

### Description

Wine is important for civilized people, or at least it is to me.

And these civilized people must have their unique preferences that most wine should be sold that matches with their special tastes.

However, these special tastes also have their standard that creates ratings and popluarity. 

Then, what makes some wine to be more popular and higher ratings?

The primary purpose of this project is to answer 3 questions :

1.  Q: Do wines with higher alcoholic content receive better ratings? 

2.  Q: Do sweeter wines receive higher ratings?

3.  Q: What level of acidity receives the highest average rating?

Thank you so much for reading this.
